                  Oztaj has been founded by Mandeep Manchanda.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prior to establishing Oztaj, Mandeep spent close to 12 years with Deloitte, with the last six years as a
                  Tax Partner and Leader in charge of Deloitte’s Offshore Delivery Centre in India.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mandeep was instrumental in setting up Deloitte Australia’s Global Delivery Centre in India, scaling the practice from 10 to over 200 Tax professionals, along with leading 800 professionals supporting various functions across different streams such as Consulting, Audit, and Advisory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Offshore Delivery Centres, under Mandeep’s leadership, enabled Deloitte Australia achieve the growth targets year-on-year while addressing the shortage of skilled manpower.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mandeep is a Registered Tax Agent and has been a full member of CPA Australia for over 13 years. In
                  addition, Mandeep is a member of SMSF Association in Australia.
                </p>
                <p>These varied qualifications and experiences have given Mandeep a unique combination of Tax,
                  Business, and Technology skills. This has enabled Mandeep to identify opportunities for growth and
                  process improvement.</p>
                  <p>Mandeep’s philosophy has been to grow by simplifying processes, appraising technology and
                    glocalization.</p>
                    <p>
                      Mandeep lives in Melbourne with his wife and two kids. He is a Hawks supporter, member of a local tennis club and likes to read fiction novels in his free time. Mandeep is also learning a new language and is working on a novel.

                      It is that simple, our motto is very clear – we want to simplify and assist you with delivery of tax
                      compliance services for you so that you can concentrate on other things that are important to you
                      and your business.

                    <p>
                      We realise that many accounting and audit businesses prefer to spend time with their clients, providing them with important and strategic advice. And for these practices, the process of delivering compliance services to their clients is taking significant time and effort, while not contributing to their bottom line. Not to mention massive staff shortages are making it harder for many businesses to delivery effectively to their clients.
